Phishing Awareness Simulation tool developed in Python to educate users on phishing attacks and improve cybersecurity awareness.
# Phishing Awareness Simulation 🎣

This project is a Phishing Awareness Simulation tool developed during my 3-month cybersecurity internship at Threat Prism One Stop AI. The tool is designed to educate users about phishing attacks by simulating phishing scenarios and measuring their responses.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Simulates common phishing email scenarios to raise awareness.
- Tracks user interactions to evaluate susceptibility to phishing attempts.
- Provides feedback and educational tips to improve cybersecurity hygiene.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (for scripting and automation)
- Basic web technologies (HTML/CSS for email templates, if applicable)
- Data analysis tools for reporting user responses

## 📄 Documentation
Complete project report and simulation details are available in [Phishing_Awareness_Simulation_Report.pdf](./Phishing_Awareness_Simulation_Report.pdf).

## 🚀 Impact
- Helped increase phishing awareness among simulated users during the internship.
- Enabled the identification of potential vulnerabilities related to human factors in cybersecurity.
